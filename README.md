# Create the file garden.py for this task.
1. Use some Garden Path sentences or think up your own (at least 5).
2. Tokenise and perform Entity recognition for each of the sentences after you have stored them in a list 
called gardenpathSentences.
3. See how spaCy has categorised these sentences and look up the entities you don't understand.
4. At the bottom of your file, write a comment about two unusual entities you found that spaCy gave one of the words 
of your sentences - did you expect this?
